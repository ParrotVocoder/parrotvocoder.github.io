        It would be unfair to avoid the subject of speaking abilities of macaws and other parrots. 
        Macaws can reproduce the sound of human speech quite well or with various types of distortion. 
        The matter becomes difficult because some sources state that macaws are not very good talkers, 
        while others claim that macaws are excellent speakers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is insufficient space here to explain why. In a nutshell: Arielle achieves a level of 
        speech that is unparalleled. Her words in the speech clip below reveal that she can do 
        something unusual.

        Arielle often assembles series of untutored statements. In this example she makes a
        pronoun substitution that shows a small portion of her understanding of English.

        <strong>A</strong>rielle hopes that you find her story informative and interesting.
        She is a parrot-like bird whose relatives originally lived in tropical environments 
        including the savannahs and rain forests of South America. Arielle is a member of the 
        species <em>Ara ararauna</em> commonly known as the Blue and Gold macaw.
      </p>

      <p>
        Brightly colored macaws are the largest parrot-like birds in the New World; their 
        usual imposing size is between 33 to 36 inches from the crown of their head to the tip 
        of their tail. If you imagine a macaw without its 20-24 inch tail feathers, the parrot 
        would be about the size of a two-pound chicken.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hobbyists and pet owners keep more Blue and Gold macaws than any other type of 
        macaw, so a Blue and Gold macaw, like Arielle, is not considered a rare bird. What 
        makes macaws popular parrots?
      </p>

      <p>
        People are attracted to macaws by their sleek beauty and brilliant colors. Beyond their 
        physical beauty, the birds have common endearing traits and develop individual 
        personalities. Some macaws are very active birds, and they love to play with toys and 
        disassemble things.
      </p>

      <p>
        A macaw's antics keep the bird amused and can entertain its owners; however, care 
        needs to be taken because large parrots can inadvertently ruin things in and around a 
        home. Owners need to provide the birds with wooden-chew toys and people need to 
        be vigilant about the bird's activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an example, a playful macaw, when unsupervised, can destroy household objects. 
        Arielle has at times chewed on wood molding around a doorway near her cage. When 
        she is free in the house, she can walk up a spiral staircase and mount a wooden rail 
        along the edge of our loft. She damaged the railing by breaking small chunks from the 
        wood. This behavior is not done in spite; the bird is doing what comes naturally: wood 
        is for chewing, and girls just like to have fun!
      </p>

      <p>
        Macaws, like other parrots, benefit from what many people consider to be an 
        inordinate amount of time with their owners. This is no coincidence. In the wild many 
        parrot species pair off as monogamous couples and spend a lifetime together.
      </p>

      <p>
        People ask me how much time one needs to properly care for a bird like Arielle. My 
        answer is 4 hours a day extending over 365 days a year.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, for a number of reasons, four hours is not an overly generous accounting for the 
        time it takes to look after one's bird. It's like having a second wife, but each of us 
        knows that before we buy a bird. The trouble is that most birds are short changed and 
        it's not right. Don't buy a large bird unless you can forever devote four hours of each 
        day to your feathered friend.

        Arielle said spontaneously, "I'm a pretty, ... pretty girl!" The significance of her 
        statement exceeds the simplicity of the words she speaks. Arielle is substituting 
        pronouns in her speech, creating a new variation of what she was told.
