        Arielle speaks freely and through the words she has learned, she assembles coherent 
        combinations of sentences, which represent her thoughts. She is the first macaw to 
        reveal such a linguistic ability through her free speech. One might argue that the 
        study of natural bird communication leads to the idea that birds have language, so 
        by learning human language, an astute parrot is merely learning a second language.

      <h2>Another Kind of Mind:</h2>
      <h3>A Talking Bird Masters English</h3>
    </section>

    <section class="about-book">
      <p>
        What animal speaks using coherent language that is understandable by man? A talking bird 
        called Arielle does. The interspecies barrier broke when Arielle began to communicate by 
        volunteering information through English statements. She is a beautiful 19-year-old tropical 
        bird that expresses herself spontaneously using more than 4000 English words, phrases, and 
        sentences. Her verbal progress compares to that of a young child.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Beatles tune, "Got to get you into my life," presented a nagging riddle. The puzzle 
        resolved after years of walking down a road with my macaw, Arielle. The cryptic lyric, 
        "… find another kind of mind there," inspired me to describe my linguistic adventure with 
        a talking bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arielle has the ability to communicate across species using human speech when she wishes 
        to do so. Those who know Arielle and listen carefully to recordings of her voluntarily 
        spoken private monologues discover that her speech reveals her thoughts. Readers understand 
        Arielle's speech by considering her statements with the provided background information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hundreds of transcriptions of Arielle's voluntary speech reveal meaningful messages that 
        form the core of <em>Another Kind of Mind</em>. An unanticipated statement by Arielle reveals 
        that she listens to what people say and that she is capable of attributing speech to an 
        individual by name. Many of her statements provide concrete examples that one talking bird 
        can learn to communicate ideas through human language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Another Kind of Mind</em> traces a bird's speech development. The book provides details 
        about how Arielle can:
      </p>
      <ul class="abilities-list">
        <li>vocalize in a previously little recognized purr-like voice,</li>
        <li>construct a monologue or dialogue about a topic,</li>
        <li>reveal her sensory impressions about the environment,</li>
        <li>substitutes nouns and personal pronouns correctly,</li>
        <li>rhyme, express emotion, and construct verbal jokes,</li>
        <li>apply logic in her speech and speak using proper syntax,</li>
        <li>organize thoughts using phrases and sequences of statements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Another Kind of Mind</em> guides readers toward understanding Arielle's English words, 
        phrases, and sentences, as her expressions provide insight into her mind, personality, and 
        thoughts. Her meaningful speech communicates something never before evident from utterances 
        made by a bird. Arielle is a conscious being.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are not able to perfectly understand the speech samples below on first hearing, you 
        are not alone. By coordinating the sound clips with the text in the book, readers typically 
        understand between 65% and 95% of Arielle's utterances. The macaw speaks an unusual dialect 
        of English.

          <h4>Suggestions for listening to Arielle's speech samples</h4>
          <p>
            Good isolating headphones offer superior listening to the speech samples because 
            room acoustics are eliminated and they help a listener to concentrate on Arielle's words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frustration quickly sets in after a short time, so if you really want to understand 
            her words, return at a later time to listen to the clip.
          </p>
          <p>Ask children what they hear.</p>
          <p>It helps sometimes to listen from across the room from a loudspeaker.</p>
          <p>
            As one begins to comprehend Arielle's statements, think of the millions of other 
            birds who likely are not understood by their owners ....
          </p>
          <p>
            The nature of the project is that Arielle speaks more than 100,000 words a year. 
            If one wishes to receive her messages, a listener must review all of the words she 
            speaks. Is it a wonder that I am 6 years behind on the project?
