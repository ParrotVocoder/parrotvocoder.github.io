        Welcome to the world of Arielle, a Blue and Gold macaw who demonstrates remarkable 
        cognitive speech abilities. Arielle doesn't just mimic—she understands and speaks 
        thoughtfully using English words, phrases, and sentences.

        <p>
          Arielle often assembles series of untutored statements. In this example she makes a
          pronoun substitution that shows a small portion of her understanding of English.
        </p>

      <AudioPlayer 
        src="/sounds/I_m_a_pretty_girl2.wav" 
        caption="Arielle saying: I'm a pretty, pretty girl!"
      />

      <HighlightBox label="Transcription:">
        <p>
          <strong>Arielle said spontaneously: I'm a pretty, pretty girl!</strong> (followed by kisses)
        </p>
        <p>
          The significance of her statement exceeds the simplicity of the words she speaks. Arielle is 
          substituting pronouns in her speech. She was told "Arielle is a pretty girl" and "You are a pretty girl" 
          but here she voluntarily inserts "I" as the subject to refer to herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the pronoun substitution, she correctly conjugates the verb to match the subject, 
          "I am," which she correctly contracts to "I'm." Neither of these phrases were modeled for her.
