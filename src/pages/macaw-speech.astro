        Originally, I hadn't intended to perform speech research with a parrot. Arielle 
        was the motivating force behind my interest in interspecies communication with
        a talking bird. It was Arielle's early ability to comprehend English words that 
        started my quest to understand how she learned to use words correctly in new 
        situations; she exhibited her ability to apply words correctly, even though she 
        had received no instruction for the particular expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        The articles on this page are edited from my manuscript for a yet-to-be-
        published book about our first six years together, tentatively titled 
        <em>Arielle: A Macaw's Diary</em>. This is one of two manuscripts I have written 
        dealing with free speech by a talking bird.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been involved with Arielle and her use of the English language for
        eighteen years. During the time, I've learned a great amount from her about
        the ability of talking birds to understand and to use human language correctly.

        On occasion, Arielle gets herself into precarious situations. In one photograph, 
        Arielle plays by hanging upside down while exploring the grapefruit tree in 
        our yard. At a distance, her coloring affords camouflage as she romps among 
        the leaves of the tree with similar hue.

      <h2>Rescue from a Tree</h2>
      
      <p>
        Arielle and I were visiting a local park; we had walked three-quarters of the 
        footpath encircling the lake. A large bird spooked Arielle, and she jumped from 
        my shoulder and flew into the wind. Her flight took her away from me over a 
        portion of the water and back toward some tall trees.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had landed on a tree branch more than 30 feet above ground. I called home 
        from a house adjacent to the park and asked my wife, Pat, to bring my rescue kit 
        to retrieve Arielle from the tree. The pole extended to 20 feet and, with a T-perch 
        attached the total length was about two feet longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Training a bird does pay off. With my heart racing and the sound of my pulse in 
        my ears, I commanded Arielle to step upon the T-perch. "UP!" I shouted in the 
        calmest sounding, most businesslike voice I could muster. Arielle raised her leg; 
        she was going to step onto the perch.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <strong>P.S.:</strong> I recommend that beginning parrot owners use a tether if 
        they want to take their birds outside. <span class="text-red">Only a disciplined parrot 
        owner, who has practiced walking with and rescuing his bird outdoors, should attempt 
        to handle an unrestrained parrot outside.</span>

      </figure>

      <p>
        During our customary walk this evening, Arielle said a distorted two-syllable word, 
        one that I did not immediately comprehend. As we walked, I made a mental note of 
        the Halloween decorations, hanging in the nearby trees, swaying in the wind. 
        After thought, the word that fit her utterance came to mind: "goblin."
      </p>

      <p>
        How had she learned to relate the ornamentation to that word? Arielle had 
        previously seen Halloween trolls, ghosts, goblins, and scarecrows around the 
        neighborhood. When "Trick or Treaters" arrive at our home, I allow the birds 
        to observe the colorful costumes worn by little "kids."
      </p>

      <p>
        To allay her fear, I told her, "Okay … No hurt!" and that the ghostly visitors 
        were "goblins." I described outdoor decorations hanging eerily from trees using 
        the label goblin as well, so that is how Arielle learned to say goblin.

      <p>
        Arielle was the subject of a discussion recorded by Story Corps, part of the 
        National Sound Archives when they visited the Tampa Bay Area. A portion 
        of the interview about instructing Arielle to learn the English language was 
        aired on NPR during the program "All Things Considered."

      <p>
        Arielle spoke in two voices. In the first part of her utterance, she employed 
        a low-frequency voice saying, "You're rotten." After a brief pause, she adds,
        "I know," which is spoken in a humorous sounding voice. A peculiar tone in her
        voice gives away what would have been a smirk on her face, if she were a 
        human being, while making the teasing comment.
