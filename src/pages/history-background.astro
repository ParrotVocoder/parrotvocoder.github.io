      <h2>RELIABLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        One important factor is to keep detailed written notes about a bird's behavior and speech. Without a written
        account as the years pass, it is more difficult to remember events of long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know, because I have been keeping records for more than ten years. Those notes are invaluable in evaluating
        what happened, the meaning, and the relationship between events. In my case, I discovered that there were
        patterns in Arielle's speech and that she used words knowingly to refer to objects, places, and animals that she
        experienced in her environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the suggestion of a friend, ten years ago I started recording Arielle's speech. Low cost methods include
        tape, CD, or digital recording as ways to document a shy bird's speech! (Does your bird clam-up when strangers
        visit?)
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you or friends do not understand what your bird says, recorded sounds can be evaluated by others.
        Arielle says many things that people do not understand without clues. There are many reasons for a person
        unfamiliar with a parrot's speech to find strings of speech incomprehensible. A few of the reasons are that she
        speaks in different voices, her dialect is that of a bird, and she uses a wide variety of words that most people
        do not conceive that a bird would know, let alone utter. For more information, click on the link to go to the <a
          href="/difficulties-interspecies-communication">Words & Sound</a
        > page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep recording your bird's speech. Others interested in this topic and I will help you to evaluate what your
        bird is saying.

          Bird owners and others do not understand novel speech by talking birds. The author played speech samples from species
          of talking birds to illustrate how poorly we perceive our own language spoken by a bird. Recordings of bird speech
          reveal that some parrots understand English.

          <strong>Dalton, Michael. (2012)</strong> "Beyond ... 'Polly Wants a Cracker:'—Parrots Using Language" Presentation
          made before The 2012 All-American Hookbill Fair & Seminar sponsored by the Gateway Parrot Club at the Machinists
          Hall, Bridgeton MO (St. Louis), 25 August 2012. (Similar topics to those above with emphasis on the ability of parrots
          to learn language.)<br />
          Speech recordings demonstrate that parrot-like birds are learning English. The speaker's bird, Arielle, substitutes
          pronouns, conjugates verbs, speaks series of synonymous terms, and can pose and answer her own questions. Recordings
          of free bird speech illustrate that some parrots understand English; a macaw understands language—sequences of up
          to four sentences about a single topic are evidence. The bird's speech reveals that she is a conscious being with
          a "Theory of Mind."
